## Parámetros

### amp:
- **Descripción**: The amplitude of the sound. Typically a value between 0 and 1. Higher amplitudes may be used, but won't make the sound louder, they will just reduce the quality of all the sounds currently being played (due to compression.)
- **Default**: 1
- **Restricciones**: must be zero or greater
- Puede cambiarse mientras se reproduce
- Tiene parámetros de slide para dar forma a los cambios

### mix:
- **Descripción**: The amount (percentage) of FX present in the resulting sound represented as a value between 0 and 1. For example, a mix of 0 means that only the original sound is heard, a mix of 1 means that only the FX is heard (typically the default) and a mix of 0.5 means that half the original and half of the FX is heard.
- **Default**: 1
- **Restricciones**: must be a value between 0 and 1 inclusively
- Puede cambiarse mientras se reproduce

### pre_mix:
- **Descripción**: The amount (percentage) of the original signal that is fed into the internal FX system as a value between 0 and 1. With a pre_mix: of 0 the FX is completely bypassed unlike a mix: of 0 where the internal FX is still being fed the original signal but the output of the FX is ignored. The difference between the two is subtle but important and is evident when the FX has a residual component such as echo or reverb. When switching mix: from 0 to 1, the residual component of the FX's output from previous audio is present in the output signal. With pre_mix: there is no residual component of the previous audio in the output signal.
- **Default**: 1
- **Restricciones**: must be zero or greater

### pre_amp:
- **Descripción**: Amplification applied to the input signal immediately before it is passed to the FX.
- **Default**: 1
- **Restricciones**: must be zero or greater

### pan:
- **Descripción**: Position of sound in stereo. With headphones on, this means how much of the sound is in the left ear, and how much is in the right ear. With a value of -1, the sound is completely in the left ear, a value of 0 puts the sound equally in both ears and a value of 1 puts the sound in the right ear. Values in between -1 and 1 move the sound accordingly.
- **Default**: 0
- **Restricciones**: must be a value between -1 and 1 inclusively
